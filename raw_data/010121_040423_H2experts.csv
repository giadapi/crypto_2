2022-08-10 04:08:24+00:00,hentaiavenger66,"@ThomasCrown__ @notapornfolder_ I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt think Stetson stays as qb1 the entire season. Think GA loses one fluke game somewhere and they put in someone else."
2022-08-10 04:04:27+00:00,hentaiavenger66,"@bitcoinpanda69 @linkybaggs I think I might be over looking Miami this year. Hard to rank them anywhere in top 10 because of their schedule, but I think mario christobal changes the culture there. might take him a year or two. Bo Nix at Oregon also interesting."
2022-08-10 04:02:40+00:00,hentaiavenger66,"@ThomasCrown__ @notapornfolder_ As a Michigan fan, you guys were just much bigger and stronger than us last year. Wasn‚Äôt really fair. Hope y‚Äôall beat bama in sec final this year."
2022-08-10 04:00:59+00:00,hentaiavenger66,@linkybaggs @bitcoinpanda69 I‚Äôd like to think Stroud has a great year but im not sold on Henderson yet. Imo ceiling for this team is NY6 bowl. I think osu probably handles Michigan this year but loses the Penn state game
2022-08-10 03:59:29+00:00,hentaiavenger66,"@linkybaggs @bitcoinpanda69 osu did bring in a new dc, but it‚Äôs like you never really know where to rank them. big matchup on week one. can always shake things up after then."
2022-08-10 03:58:10+00:00,hentaiavenger66,"@linkybaggs @bitcoinpanda69 a few things here
1. who won the big ten last year
2. much improved offense, even more if JJ starts
3. lost our two edge rushers. two really good edge rushers can solve a mediocre defense, which is why we beat osu.
4. ohio state has an identity problem on defense."

2023-01-29 08:46:58+00:00,Bagsy,"I lost a bunch in the LUNA collapse. I lost another bunch in the FTX debacle. Demoralizing, but I live on because I didn't put all my eggs in those baskets.

I keep playing the game because I have bullets left in the chamber and know how to shoot.

Survive and keep shooting CT."
2023-01-29 08:44:03+00:00,Bagsy,"This is my 3rd crypto bear market, and I'm still getting the hang of it. I'm best at managing my risk and surviving; no matter what happens, survival is more important than maximizing returns and blowing up in the process.

You can't play this game with no bullets."
2023-01-29 08:39:28+00:00,Bagsy,"The market humbles all. Bulls and bears get slaughtered when they forget that markets work both ways, especially when every point of data they're looking at points them to that conclusion.

This shit doesn't always make sense. That's what makes it fun."
2023-01-29 08:35:26+00:00,Bagsy,"One of the more critical aspects of trading is realizing when you're dead wrong and not blowing up your account in the process of realization.

It's easy to get married to an idea when it is suitable for a long time and challenging to divorce it when conditions change on you."

2022-10-15 08:35:19+00:00,Bagsy,"How can NFT platforms gain revenue with 0% royalties across the board?

-Launchpad mints (already happening)
-Subscription-based model where users pay a fixed monthly fee to gain guaranteed access to launchpad mints and additional features.
-Ad revenue

What else?"
2022-10-15 08:01:55+00:00,Bagsy,"ME likely introduced optional royalties and a temporary 0% platform fee because of their competition gaining an advantage on them.

With 0% platform fees, I'm curious what other methods @MagicEden has to bring revenue through the door.

What do you guys think of the whole thing?"
2022-10-15 07:53:29+00:00,Bagsy,"I see the following things happen with optional royalties for creators:

-Teams will raise more at mint
-Projects that don't rug will be more incentivized to build revenue streams/create more gen 2's
-Sellers are even more likely to paper hand their holdings 
-Wash trading üëÜ"

2022-05-24 11:01:38+00:00,Bagsy,@CryptoIsRedPill @okaybears There's a difference; the majority of the RR top holders are new top holders; hence the old whales sold everything and new ones took their place.

Whales don't make up an entire community; there's a lot more to it, although they do control a lot of supply as a group. So generally, it's a good sign to see the largest investors increase their collection size rather than offload on pullbacks."

2022-03-14 17:05:00+00:00,Bagsy,"6) The point of this short thread is to try and wake some people up. It's alright to sell your favorite NFT if it'll bring safety and security to your family. There's no shame in letting go.

Nobody gives a fuck about you, people only truly care only for themselves."
2022-03-14 17:05:00+00:00,Bagsy,"6) I've seen the same thing happen over and over again with shitcoiners. You'll believe in the project, the team, the goals; yet even the most genius of teams will have their coin see -90% drawdowns in the bear market (best case); no project is immune to market cycles."
2022-03-14 17:05:00+00:00,Bagsy,"5) The example above is best case scenario.

Most commonly you'll ape into space donkey NFTs only to watch your net worth evaporate over a year until the dev dies of 'unnatural causes', making you look like an ass to your wife with nothing to show in the bank."
2022-03-14 17:04:59+00:00,Bagsy,"4) Best case is that the NFT space keeps up, @yugalabs keeps innovating and you're smart enough not to lose your private keys to social engineering scams and hacks, yet you still will never sell because well, he's your ape and this is your community, a true bagholder."
2022-03-14 17:04:59+00:00,Bagsy,"3) By selling you would risk losing your tribe and 'friends' if you sold, and future BAYC perks.

So you decide to hold on to everything; eventually the NFT space cools down, maybe you get hacked and you lose your ape. What are you left with? Fuck all and some temporary pity."
2022-03-14 17:04:59+00:00,Bagsy,"2) Let's say you were fortunate enough to join the @BoredApeYC at an early stage; the darling of the NFT space.

You're likely in a strong position with all the airdrops and freebies along the way. Yet it's unfathomable for you to ever sell your ape because, well, he's your ape."
2022-03-14 17:04:58+00:00,Bagsy,"üßµ

Tribalism in the NFT sector is fucking real. As humans we search for a group to be a part of, it's in our nature. 

However, if your goal is to put food on the table and money in the bank, tribalism will likely bankrupt you."

4th time is usually the charm when it comes to horizontal/trendline breaches; if we make a move back to 44K I think low 50K's are next at the very least. If one wants to play it safe until then, I wouldn't blame them in the least. https://t.co/omh8QxkYIY"
